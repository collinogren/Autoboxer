Always proof outputs before using them.<br>

*Autoboxer* is designed as an aid for U.S. Figure Skating accountants and aims to make lengthy stretches of copying, highlighting, and sorting papers for the box a thing of the past.<br>
The goal of this software is to be able to generate the paperwork for a day in <15 minutes + time to print.<br>
Notable features include:
- Minimal if any need to manipulate the 104.
- Error detection along with quick and simple digital proofing with fast iteration times to help catch errors and allow them to be easily corrected without wasting paper.
- Simplistic and intuitive PDF printing controls built into the program.
- Ergonomic outputs with PDF bookmarks and the ability to customize what is generated and how it is organized.
- Support for most styles of event numbering.
- Frequent updates including community-requested features and active support.
- 100% free and open source.

I hope you find this software useful and I appreciate any and all feedback. You may open an issue in Github or [email](https://www.usfsaonline.org/InternalDirectory/Officials) your feedback.<br>

## TODO
- Feature to place events on officials schedules even if there is no paperwork for them yet. This is particularly useful for dance when paperwork has to be generated after a segment the same day as the paperwork is needed.
- Complete documentation both in code and for the consumer.
