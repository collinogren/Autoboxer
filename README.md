Always proof outputs before using them.<br>

*Autoboxer* is designed as an aid for U.S. Figure Skating accountants and aims to make lengthy stretches of copying, highlighting, and sorting papers for the box a thing of the past.<br>
The goal of this software is to be able to generate the paperwork for a day in <15 minutes + time to print.<br>
Notable features include:
- Minimal if any need to manipulate the 104.
- Error detection along with quick and simple digital proofing with fast iteration times to help catch errors and allow them to be easily corrected without wasting paper.
- Simplistic and intuitive PDF printing controls built into the program.
- Ergonomic outputs with PDF bookmarks and the ability to customize what is generated and how it is organized.
- Support for most styles of event numbering.
- Frequent updates including community-requested features and active support.
- 100% free and open source.

I hope you find this software useful and I appreciate any and all feedback. You may open an issue in GitHub or [email](https://www.usfsaonline.org/InternalDirectory/Officials) your feedback.<br>

## Development
If you are interested in contributing to Autoboxer, or just want to see how it works, feel free to download the source code and have a look or tinker with it.<br>
You may open a pull request if you would like your changes merged with the master branch. No guarentees it will happen, of course.<br>
Setting up the development environment is very easy with IntelliJ which is what this program was made using.<br>
Simply go to File->New->Project From Version Control and enter the URL to this page.<br>
Make sure you use Bellsoft Liberica Full 21 as the JDK so as to have JavaFX support.<br>
Happy Autoboxing.

Contributions are highly appreciated and welcome. Pull requests are subject to review and comments.
The review process is a friendly peer review to ensure high code quality standards in the codebase.

1. Either choose an existing issue to work on, or make a new issue to work on. Just make sure it is documented.
2. Make a fork of the original Autoboxer repository.
3. Clone the forked repo to your IDE.
4. Make a single, short-lived branch for each issue you work on. Please use the (truck-based development branching model)[https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/].
5. Make the desired changes to the code and push to your repository.
6. Come back to this page and go to "pull requests" and make a pull request to merge your fork into master.
   + Include screenshots and videos when applicable of features or bugfixes.
   + Link related issue(s) to the PR.
   + Clearly enumerate what tangible changes were made.
8. Wait for code review.

Code reviews will be performed by Collin Ogren and merging of pull requests are contingent on his approval.
## Code Standards
- Autoboxer uses both functional and object oriented approaches, but tends to be more functional that OOP.
- Treat classes more like structs and prefer records when possible.
- Use functional programming when possible. Need a new feature? You probably should write it functionally.
- Avoid monoliths.
- Prefer implementing interfaces over extending classes.
- Write for clarity, safety, and maintainability over being overly concise.
- Always use braces and place the opening brace on the same line as declarations.
- Following up on the previous entry, no braceless control structures ever.
