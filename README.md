This program is in early developmental stages and does not yet perform its intended functionality. Check back later.<br>
A massive thank you to this wonderful community, I hope you find this software useful, let me know if you have any issues.<br>
And to my friend and mentor John Marasco, for his many years of excellent guidance and highly enjoyable weekends, this one's for you.
## Usage Guidelines
- Make sure that officialsâ€™ names for Hal2 match those in ISUCalc because otherwise you will get a separated output PDF containing IJS in one and 6.0 in the other. Best practice is to copy and paste from the official's directory into Hal2 so as to avoid any discrepancies.
- Generally, his program works largely by matching strings so some amount of consistency is required for optimal results. For example, while the program reads 34a and 34A as the same, it will not read 34a the same as 34 a.
- Finally, proof the generated "box" against the 104 to ensure no unforeseen issues arose.
## TODO
- [x] Read a file derived from the 104 to serve as a guide for sorting paperwork.
- [x] Assign event numbers and file types for PDF print outputs from ISUCalc and IJSCompanion.
- [x] Assign event numbers and file types for PDF print outputs from Hal2.
- [ ] Create a "box" out of processed paperwork which includes the following:
- [ ] Circle or otherwise mark each official on the coversheet of each set.
- [ ] Copy and sort files for every official.

## Disclaimer
This is a tool designed to make your job easier but this is alpha software with little testing so please make sure you proof the outputs of the program and remember it is your responsibility to ensure the accuracy of the paperwork. Even after this program becomes more stable and tested I still highly recommend always double checking to make sure everything is accurate.
